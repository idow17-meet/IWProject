The following is the plan for how the game will send and receive highscores from the database.

The server will have a database which consists of a person's google id (ex: 3213123231111285) and his highscore (ex: 2)
Done!

When you start the game (load flappy_moshe.html) it will use WWW (or a javascript get request, need to check)
at websiteurl.com/highscores/userid and then save that highscore into playerPrefs.highscore.
ID (users google id) will be received from a javascript script which will fetch the logged in user's id
(note: probably gonna go with www)

Idea: websiteurl.com/getcurrentid will return current user's google id (which is how fetching highscore will work)
Done!

When you lose (or when you switch page, need to check when exactly) if the new score is the higher than highscore
Unity will call WWW (maybe with a WWWForm, or maybe just secured get request)
on websiteurl.com/submit-highscore with the user id and score
On the server side, if the score is higher than the current one in the database, it will save it.

Then, in another page, websiteurl.com/leaderboards there will be a table of all users and their scores, sorted by
the highest scored
